# The Method

The Rayleigh Ritz Method is nothing but applying Finite Elements to Structural problems. Basically you split your structure into smaller structures that can easily be solved By solving, I mean, Calculate the specific stifness of the Structure in order to determine how the loads affects the structure. Once the individual mini-strutures are solved they are ensembled into a Merged Matrix equivalent to the total Stiffness of the Structure.

The purpose of this Document is not get into deep details about the Method. If you want to learn about this you can go to this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/stiffness-method) to learn the Maths behind this. The idea is to show how to implement this in R. Since this is a computational expensive method I'll be using `library(Rcpp)`.

```{r figs1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:figs1}Problem Structure"}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/3_bar_problem.jpg')
```
