<h1>The Method</h1>
<p>The Rayleigh Ritz Method is nothing but applying Finite Elements to Structural problems. Basically you split your structure into smaller structures that can easily be solved By solving, I mean, Calculate the specific stifness of the Structure in order to determine how the loads affects the structure. Once the individual mini-strutures are solved they are ensembled into a Merged Matrix equivalent to the total Stiffness of the Structure.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Document is not get into deep details about the Method. If you want to learn about this you can go to this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/stiffness-method">paper</a> to learn the Maths behind this. The idea is to show how to implement this in R. Since this is a computational expensive method Iâ€™ll be using <code>library(Rcpp)</code>.</p>
