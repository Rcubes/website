## Deep Learning

Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance. I remember to have had a College subject called Operational Investigation Fundamentals and they taugth Artifical Intelligence algorithms. Neural networks were mentioned but I never thought I could even understand what they were about.
During my first real job (as a quasi-Engineer) I always thougth I never paid sufficient attention to that subject. The subject basically covered some optimization models and for some reason **AI** was there, just sky-high level mentions in some classes.

Then I remember during my **Data Science Program**, we had 3 different Research Projects (this was at my Butterflies and Unicorns time, if you don't know what I'm talking, go here). One was Data Analytics to Measure Cars Price (super-duper boring), the second was Using Sentiment Analysis to Understand whether Lyrics of Top 20 Billboard were related to Decade's Most Important Facts (I did this, and it was super interesting) and there was a third one I really tried to sneak out: Sentiment Annalysis with Machine Learning. Machine Learning sounded really scary to be my very first Data Science Project, so I put it off.

It turns out that a colleague just joined my team at EVS and he had this awesome Max Kuhn book: [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.bookdepository.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/9781461468486?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=CL&utm_content=Applied-Predictive-Modeling&selectCurrency=CLP&w=AF4JAU961V0NQ9A803TP&pdg=pla-309526196374:kwd-309526196374:cmp-1653769863:adg-64191594660:crv-318349950654:pid-9781461468486:dev-c&gclid=CjwKCAjw-ZvlBRBbEiwANw9UWplud3A9daFx70SYI7-0t29OmknuQProNRgQtt39d572kbgsKqflBhoCwV8QAvD_BwE). And I thought: __"I'm more experienced now, so probably I can take a look at this"__. And well I discovered `caret` and completely blew my mind (But I still dislike its little to null compatibility with Tidyverse, but thanks Max Kuhn for creating `parsnip`).

Then Nico, I think, was the first guy mentioning Deep Learning, because he created the XoR problem in VBA and also took Andrew Ng specialization Course, and 
I started to feel interested in the Field.

Well, I dicovered Keras, the R API just came out (I think so) and I got this other super Book: [Deep Learning with R](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X) and I just learned so much, but not enough. I think I learned a bit of Keras but I suddenly realized I had no idea about the inner black-box, so I just wanted to learn and understand what the hell is happening inside that box.

Well here I am... Trying to understand... and I didn't do very well. Internet has little to no information about theory. Codes are everywhere, but why that code is useful is just not important for users.

So my intent is creating content (R based obviously, because R is not popular for Deep Learning either) for me to learn, and hopefully spread the word about this.

Well, the thing is I need to finish my Thesis, and my Professor told me: __"Why don't you combine what you know about Deep Learning (sincerely, not too much) with Structure Engineering?__ And you know what, this is something really unexplored in the field, so here I go. 

Hopefully publishing my findings help to have a better understanding of what I'm doing, also i can keep track of it and help others on my way (I love teaching, so this is a good way to get started).

Hope to have news about my Thesis soon...
