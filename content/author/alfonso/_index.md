I'm almost a Civil Engineer that for **_well-unknown_**  reasons ended up working as a Data Scientist prior to finish my Thesis Project (more to come on this) and it seems I enjoy it.  
I love solving the Rubiks's Cube when analizing data in R, that should be enough insight to figure out **_why the site name_**.

I worked at Evalueserve during 4 years on some interesting and a lot of not-so-interesting Data Science projects. I started getting bored since R started to be banned from Production Processes (probably I'll write about this later) so I decided to come up with this site to showcase the Power of R and some use-cases in my Thesis.

The purpose of this site is to honor Yihui Xie's quote: **__"I web, therefore I am ~~Spiderman~~"__** (but I have to say I feel more identified with Tony Stark, not because I'm a Genius, Billionaire, Playboy nor Philanthropist, but I like his creativity...and his **Armor**)  and of course learn together about how R can achieve really cool Data Science Stuffs. I feel I'm a pretty advanced useR, I've been using R since I joined EVS and the **Tidyverse** just changed my life.  

In my spare time I like to solve the Rubik's Cube (of course!! :stuck_out_tongue:), I average around 13 Seconds (by 2019-03) and play some Table Tennis . I'm a Big Fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I haven't read any comics, I just like the Movies) and I really enjoyed [**Avengers: Endgame**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyGGLB542ks).  

My native Language is Spanish, so please forgive me for any Language aberration I can posibly write in the near future (I'm planning to have a Spanish Version too, but I'm still learning **Blogdown**). I'm happily married to Valentina since 2015 and ~~J.A.R.V.I.S~~ Jesus is my ~~co~~pilot.
