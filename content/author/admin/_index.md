I´m a Civil Engineer, but I got to know Data Science and I just loved it. I´ve worked the last 4 years as an R developer, involved in almost every aspect of the Data Science Workflow.

I love teaching and I aspire to eventually teach R classes to help Data Scientist around the world know and get better with this awesome language.

In my spare time I love Drumming, playing Table Tennis, solving the Rubik´s Cube and spending time with my beautiful wife Valentina.
