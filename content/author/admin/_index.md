I'm a Civil Engineer that for well-unknown reasons ended up working as a Data Scientist and it seems I enjoy it.
I've been working for Evalueserve the last 4 years working in some interesting and not so interesting Data Science projects. I ran into Machine Learning without looking for it and I really liked it. 

I learned to program in Pascal, and my first real work code was in VBA. During the Data *Science Program* I knew a very limited version of R (I have to say I didn't learn from the very best)  but from then I haven't stopped. The *Tidyverse* is the best addition to my skills and have changed my programing life in a 100%. I started using the *Tidyverse* since 2017 and I'm trying to become a *"Full Stack R Developer"* if this term happens to exist any soon.

The purpose of this site is to honor Yihui Xie's quote: "I web, therefore I am ~~Spiderman~~" (but I have to say I feel more identified with Tony Stark, not because I'm a Genius, Billionaire, Playboy nor Philanthropist, but I like his creativity...and his armor)  and share knowledge (I will teach but I definitely think I will learn a lot more) about Where, Who and Why is ~~Gamora~~ *R*. 

I feel I'm a pretty advanced useR, I've been using R by the last 4 years but I'm planning to build up some expertise across the whole *Tidyverse*.

In my spare time I like to solve the Rubik's Cube, I average around 13 Seconds (by 2019-03) and play some Table Tennis. As you can see above I'm a Big Fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I haven't read any comics, I just like the Movies) and i can't wait to see **Avengers: End Game**.

My native Language is Spanish, so please forgive me for any Language aberration I can posibly write in the near future (I'm planning to have a Spanish Version too, but I'm still learning **Blogdown**). I'm happily married with Valentina for the past 4 years and ~~J.A.R.V.I.S~~ Jesus is my ~~co~~pilot.
