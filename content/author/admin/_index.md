I'm a Civil Engineer that for **_well-unknown_**  reasons ended up working as a Data Scientist and it seems I enjoy it.  
I've been working at Evalueserve for the last 4 years working in some interesting and a lot of not-so-interesting Data Science projects. I started getting bored and suddenly I ran into Machine Learning without looking for it but i don't have a lot of chances to use it in my current role. 

The purpose of this site is to honor Yihui Xie's quote: **__"I web, therefore I am ~~Spiderman~~"__** (but I have to say I feel more identified with Tony Stark, not because I'm a Genius, Billionaire, Playboy nor Philanthropist, but I like his creativity...and his **Armor**)  and of course learn together about things I'm really interested in exploring but most of the time I don't have the time to do it at work.

I feel I'm a pretty advanced useR, I've been using R by the last 4 years and the **Tidyverse** just changed my life.

In my spare time I like to solve the Rubik's Cube, I average around 13 Seconds (by 2019-03) and play some Table Tennis. I'm a Big Fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I haven't read any comics, I just like the Movies) and I can't wait to see **Avengers: End Game**.

My native Language is Spanish, so please forgive me for any Language aberration I can posibly write in the near future (I'm planning to have a Spanish Version too, but I'm still learning **Blogdown**). I'm happily married with Valentina for the last 4 years and ~~J.A.R.V.I.S~~ Jesus is my ~~co~~pilot.
