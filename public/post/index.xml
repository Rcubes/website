      <description>Latin R (Conferences Days)Today the Conference Days just got started, and I have to say I watched some really impresive presentations and Data Products.
Day 1 started with a UAI local presenter talking about Sports Analytics in R, then a huge presentation by Mine Cetinkaya about Teaching R to move to specific small presentation in parallel so I was able just to watch half of the Presentations.
Day 2 started with a UC local presenter talking about applying Data Science in R to Government Data, then Erin Ledell talked about H2o to move forward to the small presentations in Parallel.</description>

      <description>Latin R (Tutorials Day)Today Latin R just got started. It was really impressive to see how many people actually uses R. I have to say the popularity of Python in Data Science has always been something that worries me tons, but today I was able to see a lot of other Areas where people actually use R. Probably I was one of the few people working in Data Science there.</description>

      <description>Latin RLatin R is a conference organized by RLadies Latam and is the oportunity we have here in Chile to get acquainted about the last R breakthrough and how is being using in Research, companies, etc.They also provide a full day of Tutorials and of course important keynotes are invited to come over. This year I think is huge, because 3 Main R users are coming:
Mine Ã‡etinkaya-RundelShe is one of the most important persons involved into R Teaching.</description>

      <description>Deep Learning Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance. I remember to have had a College subject called Operational Investigation Fundamentals and they taugth Artifical Intelligence algorithms. Neural networks were mentioned but I never thought I could even understand what they were about. During my first real job (as a quasi-Engineer) I always thougth I never paid sufficient attention to that subject. The subject basically covered some optimization models and for some reason AI was there, just sky-high level mentions in some classes.</description>

      <description>Why am I not graduated yet? Graduation is something we all are longing. Well, I recognize this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been evading. The main reason is because I&amp;rsquo;m not working on what I studied. But, what the hell, I think I like Data Science.
Ok, Long Story Short&amp;hellip; I was about to study Mathematical Engineering but I asked myself, where can I possibly work as a Mathematical Engineer ? (In my current job, obviously ðŸ˜…)</description>
