      <description>Latin RLatin R is a conference organize by RLadies Latam and is the oportunity we have here to know the last breakthrough and how is being using in Research, companies, etc.They also provide a full day of Tutorials and of course important keynotes are invited to come over. This year I think is huge 3 Main R users are coming:
Mine Ã‡etinkaya-RundelShe is one of the most important persons involved into R Teaching.</description>

      <description>1 Importing Data2 Redefining Categorical Variables3 Discovering Missing Values4 ConclusionDuring my Machine Learning Diploma I had the chance to work on a very interesting project that was actually created in SAS. Of course I absolutely refused to use that old fashioned tool and I move everything to R.
I will try to demonstrate as much of the packages I used to perform this analysis.</description>

      <description>1 Checking Numerical Distribution2 Checking Categorical Variables3 Chi-Square Test4 ConclusionLast time we conducted a high level cleansing of the data. Now itÂ´s time to understand what is going on in it. In order to do that weÂ´ll use a lot ggplot to visualize the data.
1 Checking Numerical DistributionIn order to do this I should pick Numerical Variables one by one and create a ggplot.</description>

      <description>Deep Learning Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance. I remember to have had a College subject called Operational Investigation Fundamentals and they taugth Artifical Intelligence algorithms. Neural networks were mentioned but I never thought I could even understand what they were about. During my first real job (as a quasi-Engineer) I always thougth I never paid sufficient attention to that subject. The subject basically covered some optimization models and for some reason AI was there, just sky-high level mentions in some classes.</description>

      <description>Why am I not graduated yet? Graduation is something we all are longing. Well, I recognize this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been evading. The main reason is because I&amp;rsquo;m not working on what I studied. But, what the hell, I think I like Data Science.
Ok, Long Story Short&amp;hellip; I was about to study Mathematical Engineering but I asked myself, where can I possibly work as a Mathematical Engineer ? (In my current job, obviously ðŸ˜…)</description>
