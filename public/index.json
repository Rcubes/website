Si bien es cierto es posible utilizar Redes convolucionales para otras aplicaciones, el an√°lisis de im√°genes y la Visi√≥n Computacional son la especialidad de estas redes.\nLa Principal ventaja sobre una Red neural normal es que no est√° densamente conectada. Sino que selecciona cuidadosamente las neuronas a las que se conectar√° cambiando la operaci√≥n matricial de Producto Punto por una convoluci√≥n.\nLa definici√≥n formal de Convoluci√≥n es:\n\\[ (f * g)(x)= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{f(\\eta)\\cdot g(x-\\eta) d\\eta} \\] La interpretaci√≥n m√°s cl√°sica de esta integral corresponde al producto de funciones al desplazar una por sobre la otra.\n¬øC√≥mo se relaciona esto con las Redes Convolucionales?\rEl an√°lisis de Im√°genes es bastante complicado. La manera en la que un computador es capaz de ver una im√°gen es parseando e interpretandola por un Tensor de Pixeles. Dependiendo de la resoluci√≥n dela Imagen este Tensor ser√° cada vez m√°s grande, por lo tanto usar Redes Densas supone un gran costo computacional por todos los $ w_{i,j}$ que ser√° necesario calcular.\nNormalmente el an√°lisis de Im√°genes utiliza tensor de este estilo:\n\r\rFigure 1: Estructura de Tensores de Im√°genes\r\r\rLa Matriz de Pixeles de Dimensiones Alto x Ancho m√°s una Pofundidad de Canales RGB que dan el color.\nEs por esto que las redes convolucionales ocupan esta operaci√≥n para reconocer patrones espec√≠ficos dentro del Tensor de Imagen. La manera en que est√° convoluci√≥n se lleva a cabo es por medio de un Filtro. Este filtro es otro Tensor que posee generalmente dimensiones de 3x3 o 5x5 el cual se desplaza a trav√©s del tensor de im√°genes para construir un Mapa de Caracter√≠sticas.\n\r\r\r\r\rFigure 2: Aplicaci√≥n de un Filtro en redes Convolucionales\r\r\r\rNormalmente luego de la Aplicaci√≥n del Filtro el Mapa de Caracter√≠sticas es pasado por una ReLU lo que genera que se realcen ciertos atributos de la imagen lo que permite que la red aprenda a diferenciar caracter√≠sticas espec√≠ficas.\nDependiendo del filtro aplicado, se ver√°n ciertos atributos de la imagen o no. Cabe destacar que los filtros parten como n√∫meros aleatorios que se van entrenando en los distintos Pasos de la red (Forward and Backward).\nSi intentamos analizar la foto de un gato, luego de aplicar filtros, esto es lo que un computador comienza a ver:\n\r\rFigure 3: Feature Map\r\r\rFigure 4: Resultado del Entrenamiento de Filtros\r\r\r\r¬øC√≥mo se va especializando la red para ser cada vez m√°s detallista?\rLuego de la red Convolucional hay una reducci√≥n de Dimensionalidad, para llevarse acabo se utiliza una Capa de pooling, esta puede ser una Average Pooling o Max Pooling (generalmente √©sta √∫ltima es la m√°s utilizada) la cual reduce la dimensi√≥n del problema para luego aplicar una nueva Capa de Red convolucional pero con m√°s filtros que el paso anterior.\r\r\r\r\rFigure 5: Max Pooling\r\r\rUna vez que se ha llegado al nivel de espacializaci√≥n deseado, se llevan todas las caracter√≠cticas a un vector que es pasado por una capa densamente conectada para entregar los outputs correspondientes.\nUna Configuraci√≥n t√≠pica podr√≠a verse as√≠:\n\r\rFigure 6: Especializaci√≥n de la Red\r\r\r\r¬øC√≥mo se relaciona este problema con Estructuras?\rNo tiene relaci√≥n alguna. Porque este tipo de redes fue dise√±ada para el desarrollo del an√°lisis de im√°genes. Adem√°s es la manera m√°s intuitiva de analizar el funcionamiento de estas redes. Las dos principales caracer√≠sticas de las Redes Convolucionales son:\n\rLa extracci√≥n de Caracter√≠sticas\rTranslation/Shift Invariance\r\rEsto quiere decir que la red se especializa en detectar Patrones que no dependen de su posici√≥n ni que deben ser identicos para ser detectados. Por ejemplo una oreja de gato se detectara si es grande, si es peque√±a, si es de otro color si esta rotada o desplazada.\nSon estas caracter√≠sticas las que permitir√≠an desarrollar otro tipo de problemas si es que pueden ser planteadas como un tensor de im√°gen o similar.\n\r\rEl Paper de Finol\rEl Paper propone solucionar un problema cualquiera de estructuras usando redes Convolucionales. Lo que ellos primeramente plantean es la obtenci√≥n de Valores propios para un material de propiedades variables.\nPara ello se utiliza una barra dividida en 100 Elementos en las que se miden dos Propiedades, el M√≥dulo de Elasticidad E y la Densidad $ $ .\nEn simple lo que se est√° planteando es una red convolucional para analizar una Imagen de 1 Pixel de Alto por 100 de Ancho, donde los Canales que representan color, en este caso representan propiedades f√≠sicas del Elemento. Dada las propiedades de la imagen esto puede extrapolarse a que las Redes convolucionales pueden analizar Data Secuencial, en este caso cada Elemento de la Barra est√°n en secuencia debido a la continuidad del la barra. Aunque cabe destacar que la red Convolucional no se deja llevar por el orden ya que sus patrones no dependen de la posici√≥n.\nMi Supuesto:\nEsto podr√≠a traducirse en que los invesigadores pensaron en quiz√°s un elemento equivalente de un Modulo $ E_{eq} $ en serie dado que es una barra unidimensional y el orden de los $ E_{i} $ y $ _{i} $ no influyen en la propiedad equivalente final del elemento.\nAdem√°s el problema que se est√° resolviendo es de valores propios, no hay elementos externos que indiquen que el orden de las propiedades mec√°nicas influyan en el c√°lculo final.\nBajo estas caracter√≠sticas es que el uso de la Red Convolucional es v√°lida.\nSoluci√≥n\rPara resolver el problema de Valores propios para un Cristal dividido en 100 Elementos se utiliza la siguiente configuraci√≥n:\n\r\rFigure 7: Soluci√≥n de Finol\r\r\r\rSe utiliza una Red Secuencial aplicando un Filtro de Largo 3.\rAl no utilizar padding el vector se reduce a 98 x 1 x 275 donde 275 corresponde te√≥ricamente al n√∫mero de filtros que est√° utilizando. Esto no sale definido en el Paper y es algo que averigu√© investigando por mi parte.\rSe utiliza una segunda capa convolucional. La raz√≥n de esto no lo s√©. Normalmente no he visto casos de dos Capas convolucionales seguidas excepto en modelos muy avanzados.\rSe utiliza una capa Max Pooling para reducir de largo 2 que disminuye el tama√±o de la red a la mitad.\rLuego de esto se une con una Red Convencional densamente conectada. Lo que normalmente he visto es que se usa una flatten Layer que aplana la reducci√≥n de dimensiones que se ha dado hasta ahora. El valor esperado deber√≠a ser de 275 x 48, pero no s√© porque ocupa 500 nodos. *Se utilizan 3 capas ocultas para luego generar una capa de 20 unidades de salida por los 20 valores propios esperados para el problema.\r\r\rPuntos Interesantes para la Investigaci√≥n.\r\rEstoy tomando un curso en Datacamp y uno p√∫blico de Stanford acerca del uso de redes Convolucionales. Dentro del curso se dan varias recomendaciones:\n\rPara un problema de im√°genes de 64 x 64 x 3 para predecir si hay un gato en la im√°gen o no se requieren aproximadamente 10.000 im√°genes.\n\rSe recomienda usar la m√≠nima resoluci√≥n posible para distinguir a nivel humano de tal manera de bajar el poder computacional que requiere la red.\n\rA mayor resoluci√≥n m√°s im√°genes. Menor Resoluci√≥n menos Im√°genes.\n\r\rCualquier Matriz puede ser interpretada como una im√°gen. En la cual una Red Convolucional puede encontrar patrones. Por lo que perfectamente la matriz de rigidez puede ser tratado como una imagen.\n\r\r\r\rFigure 8: Transformaci√≥n de Matriz en Im√°gen\r\r\r\rLas redes convolucionales poseen propiedades de Memoria dado que su principal funci√≥n es la Extracci√≥n de Caracter√≠sticas. Existen modelos pre-entrenados de redes que Pueden usarse para perfeccionar otras tareas.\n\rUn ejemplo que le√≠ fue una red que fue pre-entrenada con im√°genes de muebles pero que luego se adapt√≥ para mejor la identificaci√≥n de animales. La red a pesar de no ser entrenada con animales, era capaz de reconocer bordes y caracter√≠sticas muy finas.\r\r\r1era Sugerencia (Quiz√°s no para la Memoria, pero para seguir investigando)\rUso de Redes convolucionales para calcular Inversas de la Matriz de Rigidez. Siendo este el proceso m√°s caro de la resoluci√≥n de estructuras quiz√°s podr√≠a realizarse el desarrollo de una Red Pre-entrenada que sea capaz de calcular Inversas de Muchas Matrices de tal Manera de agilizar el proceso m√°s caro de la resoluci√≥n de estructuras.\n\r2da Sugerencia\rSi bien las redes Convolucionales pueden dar buenos resultados para data secuencial, dada su caracteristica de ‚ÄúInvariante a la Traslaci√≥n‚Äù, puede encontrar patrones incorrectos cuando el orden s√≠ importa. Se desaconseja su uso en series de tiempo, ya que el orden de la informaci√≥n importa al momento de predecir. Para contrarestar esto, se agrega una capa de redes recurrentes (RNN) que ayuda a establecer la secuencia como un prerequisito del an√°lisis.\n\rEs posible realizar modelos paralelos en la que se ingrese data distinta como input de la Red. Por ejemplo la Matriz de Rigidez del problema como ‚Äúimagen‚Äù y los Propiedades Mec√°nicas como vector o hasta las Cargas a las que est√° sometida la estructura como vector, de esa manera todos los elementos son parte de los Input del problema para predecir de manera m√°s acertada los desplazamientos normales o umbrales del problema.\r\r\r3era Sugerencia.\rGenerar una red no secuencial considerando todos los inputs del problema.\n\rDado que el an√°lisis de las Im√°genes poseen una caracter√≠stica Espacial y secuencial me da la impresi√≥n que se puede trabajar en optimizaciones al proceso de Condensaci√≥n de Grados de Libertad. Ser√≠a posible que la red redujera problemas con gran cantidad de grados de libertad en Rigideces equivalentes que pueden ser planteadas como una im√°gen.\n\rAs√≠ mismo dado que tambi√©n posee propiedades de Profundidad podr√≠a ayudar al desarrollo de analisis de estructuras en 3 dimensiones que es algo que yo no recuerdo haber visto si no era usando algo como ETABS o SAP.\n\rMe da la impresi√≥n de que Redes Convolucionales pueden ayudar al desarrollo de Propiedades equivalentes usando su caracter√≠stica secuencial para propiedades en serie y su profundidad como propiedades en paralelo.\n\r\r\r4ta Sugerencia ‚ÄúCrear Im√°genes Estructurales‚Äù\rUtilizar la estructura de la matriz de Rigidez con 3 Canales simulando el RGB: Rigidez, Cargas en Eje X y Cargas en Eje Y. Habr√≠a que buscar una manera de modelar dentro de la matriz los apoyos, que normalmente no son considerados dentro de la Matriz a priori.\nPara un Enrejado de 9 Elementos esto ser√≠a una Im√°gen de 9 x 9 x 3, lo cual no supondr√≠a una gran cantidad de casos para entrenar.\n\r\r\r","date":1554940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554940800,"objectID":"7465b3b7e0f8a8e6deade092f6b5568a","permalink":"/project/convolutional-nets-sp/memoria-1/","publishdate":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/convolutional-nets-sp/memoria-1/","section":"project","summary":"Propuestas para Uso de CNN en estructuras.","tags":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Networks"],"title":"Propuesta Redes Convolucionales","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alfonso Tobar"],"categories":["Basics"],"content":"\r\rActivation Functions\rIdentity\rStep Function\rLinear Function\rSigmoid Function\rHyperbolic Tangent\rReLU\rLeaky ReLU\rSoftmax\r\rHow to choose the perfect Activation function?\r\r\rActivation Functions\rActivation functions are one of the most important characteristic of ANN. They basically decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. When a particular threshold is reached the Neuron will fire, meaning they will transmit the input signal to the next layer of the Network. Another Important feature of Activation Functions is that some of them provide the non-linearity. This is particular important because Activation functions help expand the range of problems that the Neural Networks can address. Finally Activation functions will play a major role when optimizing the edges weights when Backpropagation Algorithm comes into play, depending of their derivatives values is how the Gradient will change helping to decrease the error associated the Network prediction.\nSome of these Activation Functions are:\nIdentity\rIt is the most basic Activation, basically, do not alter the Neuron at all. The problem with this type of activation function is that is linear, transforming the Network into a Linear Regression limiting its classification capabilities for non-linear phenomena.\n\rStep Function\rThe binary function is extremely simple. It returns 1 if certain threshold is reached or 0 otherwise. The main drawback of this function is that his derivative is 0, meaning it is not useful in the optimizing process.\nThe function is defined as follows:\n\\[ f(x)= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lcc}\r0 \u0026amp; if \u0026amp; x \u0026lt; 0 \\\\\r\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; if \u0026amp; x \\geq 0 \\end{array}\r\\right. \\]\n\r\rFigure 1: Step Function\r\r\r\rLinear Function\rThis is another option, being the main difference the existence of a slope. In this case the derivative will be constant, which can be problematic because when trying to decrease the error no matter how right or off you are the gradient will be the same.\nThe function goes as follows:\n\\[ f(x) = a x \\]\n\r\rFigure 2: Linear Function\r\r\r\rSigmoid Function\rThis is a very popular activation function. The main advantages of this function is that it is smooth, S-shaped, it is continuously differentiable and non-linear.\nThe function is defined as follows:\n\\[ f(x)= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \\]\n\r\rFigure 3: Sigmoid Function\r\r\rThe derivative of this function is always positive and greater than 0 and x-dependent so it is very helpful when optimizing.\nOne of the setbacks is that only ranges from 0 to 1, for one thing is very limiting with the output but for the other it is particularly useful when dealing with probabilities.\n\rHyperbolic Tangent\rHyperbolic Tangent or $ tanh(x) $ is just an scaled version of the Sigmoid function. It is defined as follows:\n\\[ tanh(x)= 2 \\cdot sigmoid(2x) - 1 = \\frac{2}{1+e^{-2x}} - 1 \\]\r\r\rFigure 4: Hyperbolic Tangent Function\r\r\r$ tanh $ works similarly to sigmoid but it is symmetric at the x - axis. Normally $ tanh $ and sigmoid can be used interchangeably depending on the requirements of the problem.\n\rReLU\rReLu stands for Rectified Linear unit and it is defined as follows:\n\\[ f(x)= max(0,x) \\]\r\r\rFigure 5: ReLU Function\r\r\rIt is the most used function nowadays in hidden layers. The main capability is that it doesn‚Äôt activate all of the functions creating sparsity in the network, allowing efficiency in computation.\nThis function is limited at the positive side so it is not suggested for Output Layers. Another drawback is that not activated neurons in the range $ x \u0026lt; 0 $ will not be optimized since derivative is zero.\n\rLeaky ReLU\rThis is an improved version of the ReLU function. It is not widely used yet and it has a subtle difference with ReLu: \\[ f(x)= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lcc}\rax \u0026amp; if \u0026amp; x \u0026lt; 0 \\\\\r\\\\ x \u0026amp; if \u0026amp; x \\geq 0 \\end{array}\r\\right. \\]\n\r\rFigure 6: Leaky ReLU Function\r\r\rThis solves the problem of dead neurons during Optimization process, since the derivative of $ x \u0026lt; 0 $ is not zero.\n\rSoftmax\rThis is a sigmoid kind-of function capable of handling more than 2 classes. The function is defined as follows:\n\\[ \\sigma(z)_{j}=\\frac{e^{z_{j}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K}e^{z_{k}}} \\]\nThe softmax functions are normally used in output layers when trying to solve classification problems with more than 2 classes..\n\r\rHow to choose the perfect Activation function?\rWell, there is not a clear answer to this, but definitely some guidelines we can follow:\n\rSigmoid functions generally work better in classification problems.\rSigmoids and tanh functions are sometimes avoided due to the vanishing gradient problem.\rReLU function is a general activation function and is used in most cases these days.\rIf we encounter a case of dead neurons in our networks the leaky ReLU function is the best choice.\rAlways keep in mind that ReLU function should only be used in the hidden layers.\rAs a rule of thumb, you can begin with using ReLU function and then move over to other activation functions in case ReLU doesn‚Äôt provide with optimum results.\r\rDeep Learning with R provides some other Guidelines to use Activation Functions in the Output Layer:\n\rBinary Classification: Sigmoid\rMulticlass Single-Label Classification: Softmax\rMulticlass Multi-Label Classification: Sigmoid\rRegression to Arbitrary Values: Identity or None\rRegression to Values between 0 to 1: Sigmoid\r\r\r","date":1554681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554783338,"objectID":"7d22714745bd3ed36a07d7ead5033e85","permalink":"/project/activation-functions/activation-functions/","publishdate":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/activation-functions/activation-functions/","section":"project","summary":"Definitions of the Most Common ACtivations Functions.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Activation Functions","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alfonso Tobar"],"categories":["Basics"],"content":"\r\rWhat is an Artificial Neural Network?\rBasic Structure\rWhat Problems can Neural Networks solve?\rClassification\rRegression\r\rTypical Problems solved with Neural Networks\r\rConclusion\r\r\rWhat is an Artificial Neural Network?\rThe Picture you see up there is far a way from what a real Neural Network looks like:\nActually it is more similar to something like this:\n\r\rFigure 1: Multi-Layer Perceptron\r\r\rThe configuration showed above is nothing but a visual representation of serial Matrix Multiplications. The neural network (aka ANN that stands for Artificial Neural Networks) itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs1.\nANN are inspired by Neurons but they work in a completely different fashion. The main advantage of this system is that organizes successive Matrix multiplications and provides a visual representation of the different steps in the Optimization algorithm.\nThere are different types of Networks, Densely Connected, Convolutional, Recurrent, Long Short Memory, Radial Biased, Autoencoders, and so on. All of them having their own area of specialization, strengths and shortcomings.\nBasic Structure\rEvery Network will contain Nodes/Units, emulating Neurons and Edges, emulating the connection between Units.\nNormally the Units are organized by Layers, every Network should contain a first layer for Inputs, a last Layer for Outputs and Intermediate Layers, also known as Hidden Layers.\n\r\rFigure 2: Basic Neural Network\r\r\r\rInput Nodes $ i_{j} $ will contain Input Values to train the Network.\n\rEdges will provide weights $ w_{j} $.\n\rHidden Layer Nodes $ h_{j} $ will contain the result of Sum Product between Input Nodes and weighted edges connected to them.\n\rFinally Output Nodes $ o_{j} $ will contain the result of Sum Product between hidden Nodes and the Edges Connected to them.\n\rOptionally, Networks can include a Bias $ b_{j} $ to control values of the network.\n\r\rThe Network then will calculate values in the following way:\n\\[ h_{1} = w_{1} i_{1} + w_{2} i_{2} + b_{1} = 0.15 \\cdot 0.05 + 0.25 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.35 = 0.3825 \\]\n\\[ h_{2} = w_{2} i_{1} + w_{4} i_{2} + b_{1} = 0.20 \\cdot 0.05 + 0.30 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.35 = 0.39 \\]\n\\[ o_{1} = w_{5} h_{1} + w_{7} h_{2} + b_{2} = 0.40 \\cdot 0.3825 + 0.50 \\cdot 0.39 + 0.60 = 0.948 \\]\n\\[ o_{2} = w_{6} h_{1} + w_{8} h_{2} + b_{2} = 0.45 \\cdot 0.3825 + 0.55 \\cdot 0.39 + 0.60 = 0.986625 \\]\nThis is called a forward pass. All the Input Values were able to move through the Network by the Edge Connections up to the Output. Normally, when the Network is trained, there are expected Output values that will be compared with the ones obtained with the Forward Pass in order to compute the Error. In this case 0.01 and 0.99 respectively.\n\rWhat Problems can Neural Networks solve?\rNormally there are two Problems that Neural Networks Solves, Classification and Regression.\nClassification\rThe Classification problem is the most common problem addressed by Neural Networks. It implies to classify based on a Probability. The output will calculate how likely is that an specific label corresponds to a class. Classification problems can be sub-divided into other sub-types:\n\rBinary Classification: As the name implies, it involves two classes: Spam or not Span, Positive or Negative, Man or Woman, etc.\rMulticlass Classification: In this case several labels can be applied: Is it a Dog, Cat, Horse? What Car Brand is that? etc.\r\r\rRegression\rThis kind of problems involved calculate a number associated to a Metric. Typical Problems are predicting House Values, Temperature, Balances, Displacements, etc.\n\r\rTypical Problems solved with Neural Networks\rNeural Networks are powerful and they are the most cutting-edge methodology to make computers do the most incredibly/creepy things.\nEven though we think computers can do anything like Analyzing Photos, Driving Cars, Recognizing Animals, Predicting Prices and so on, the scope of their work is completely limited to just one thing: Computing Tensors.\nTensors are the generalization to N dimensions of Matrices. Basically any problem that can be represented by Tensors is something that Neural Networks could potentially solve.\nDifferent kind of Tensors can solve specific problems. Here some examples taken from Deep Learning with R:\n\rVector data‚Äî2D tensors of shape (samples, features): This is the Most common Data Structure Data Scientist uses in a daily basis. Basically a Matrix, having Features as Columns and Samples as Rows.\n\rTimeseries data or sequence data‚Äî3D tensors of shape (samples, timesteps, features): This is something a little bit fancier, having several timeseries organized as a collection of matrices, this creates a 3D Tensor.\n\r\r\r\rFigure 3: Multiple Timeseries data\r\r\r\rImages‚Äî4D tensors of shape (samples, height, width, channels) or (samples, channels, height, width): Images are represented as Pixel Matrices, Every Pixel also has RGB Channels giving the color properties to it, thus a 3D Tensor. Adding several samples of Images to analize and you have a 4D Tensor.\r\r\r\rFigure 4: Image Data\r\r\r\rVideo‚Äî5D tensors of shape (samples, frames, height, width, channels) or (samples, frames, channels, height, width): Videos are nothing but a collection of Sequencial Images. So You‚Äôll have different Samples of Sequencial Images producing which is a 4D Tensor, since you analize several samples of Videos, you‚Äôll get a 5D Tensor.\r\r\r\rConclusion\rNeural Networks are simple visual representations of Tensor Calcultions that are capable of addressing different real life problems. So far we have covered how the Networks transmit Information from Input to Output also called Forward Pass, but there are some other concepts that are necessary to understan in order to fully unerstand how to properly train a Neural Network.\n\r\rWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network‚Ü©\n\r\r\r","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554783338,"objectID":"5ab0020c69035456ab833ae99bb5d554","permalink":"/project/neural-nets-101/intro-to-nn/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neural-nets-101/intro-to-nn/","section":"project","summary":"Short Summary of What Neural Networks are","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Intro to Neural Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alfonso Tobar"],"categories":["Vampire Diaries"],"content":" Deep Learning Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553661585,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
