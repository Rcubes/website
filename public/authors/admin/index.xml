      <description>Latin R (Tutorials Day)Today Latin R just got started. It was really impressive to see how many people actually uses R. I have to say the popularity of Python in Data Science has always been something that worries me tons, but today I was able to see a lot of other Areas where people actually use R. Probably I was one of the few people working in Data Science there.</description>

      <description>Latin RLatin R is a conference organized by RLadies Latam and is the oportunity we have here in Chile to get acquainted about the last R breakthrough and how is being using in Research, companies, etc.They also provide a full day of Tutorials and of course important keynotes are invited to come over. This year I think is huge, because 3 Main R users are coming:
Mine Çetinkaya-RundelShe is one of the most important persons involved into R Teaching.</description>

      <description>Coming up with an Interesting Thesis Project is not easy at all. Actually I had 3 different projets and 5 different professors. None of them were really interested in my propositions. Thank God I found Dr. Marcos Valdebenito. He is really interested in Reliability Analysis in Structures and Study the Response of Random Field Variables into Strutures, you can learn more about his work on his website. Once I talked to him about I was doing in my former job he was really interested in applying Machine Learning techniques to solve this kind of problems.</description>

      <description>The MethodThe ProblemRcpp BasicsCreating an Rcpp fileStiffness MethodStiff Matrix by ElementActive DoF AssemblyConnectivity ArrayStiffness Matrix AssemblyLoad Vector AssemblySolving the ProblemConclusionsThe MethodThe Rayleigh Ritz Method is nothing but applying Finite Elements to Structural problems. Basically you split your structure into smaller structures that can easily be solved By solving, I mean, Calculate the specific stifness of the Structure in order to determine how the loads affects the structure.</description>

      <description>1 Tidymodels1.1 Spliting the Data1.2 Pre Processing2 Create the Logistic Regression3 ConclusionsNow we have an idea on how the data looks like it is time to Model.
1 TidymodelsI´m a huge fan of tidymodels framework and the way Max Kuhn has put together all of this system. I´ll be using several packages from this framework in order to show different steps of the Machine Learning Process.</description>

      <description>1 Checking Numerical Distribution2 Checking Categorical Variables3 Chi-Square Test4 ConclusionLast time we conducted a high level cleansing of the data. Now it´s time to understand what is going on in it. In order to do that we´ll use a lot ggplot to visualize the data.
1 Checking Numerical DistributionIn order to do this I should pick Numerical Variables one by one and create a ggplot.</description>

      <description>1 Importing Data2 Redefining Categorical Variables3 Discovering Missing Values4 ConclusionDuring my Machine Learning Diploma I had the chance to work on a very interesting project that was actually created in SAS. Of course I absolutely refused to use that old fashioned tool and I move everything to R.
I will try to demonstrate as much of the packages I used to perform this analysis.</description>

      <description>Activation FunctionsIdentityStep FunctionLinear FunctionSigmoid FunctionHyperbolic TangentReLULeaky ReLUSoftmaxHow to choose the perfect Activation function?Activation FunctionsActivation functions are one of the most important characteristic of ANN. They basically decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. When a particular threshold is reached the Neuron will fire, meaning they will transmit the input signal to the next layer of the Network.</description>

      <description>What is an Artificial Neural Network?Basic StructureWhat Problems can Neural Networks solve?ClassificationRegressionTypical Problems solved with Neural NetworksConclusionWhat is an Artificial Neural Network?The Picture you see up there is far a way from what a real Neural Network looks like:
Actually it is more similar to something like this:
Figure 1: Multi-Layer PerceptronThe configuration showed above is nothing but a visual representation of serial Matrix Multiplications.</description>

      <description>Deep Learning Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance. I remember to have had a College subject called Operational Investigation Fundamentals and they taugth Artifical Intelligence algorithms. Neural networks were mentioned but I never thought I could even understand what they were about. During my first real job (as a quasi-Engineer) I always thougth I never paid sufficient attention to that subject. The subject basically covered some optimization models and for some reason AI was there, just sky-high level mentions in some classes.</description>

      <description>Why am I not graduated yet? Graduation is something we all are longing. Well, I recognize this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been evading. The main reason is because I&amp;rsquo;m not working on what I studied. But, what the hell, I think I like Data Science.
Ok, Long Story Short&amp;hellip; I was about to study Mathematical Engineering but I asked myself, where can I possibly work as a Mathematical Engineer ? (In my current job, obviously 😅)</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m almost a Civil Engineer that for well-unknown reasons ended up working as a Data Scientist prior to finish my Thesis Project (more to come on this) and it seems I enjoy it.
I love solving the Rubiks&amp;rsquo;s Cube when analizing data in R, that should be enough insight to figure out why the site name.
I worked at Evalueserve during 4 years on some interesting and a lot of not-so-interesting Data Science projects.</description>
