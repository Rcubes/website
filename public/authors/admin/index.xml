      <description>Deep Learning Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance. I remember to have had a College subject called Operational Investigation Fundamentals and they taugth Artifical Intelligence algorithms. Neural networks were mentioned but I never thought I could even understand what they were about. During my first real job (as a quasi-Engineer) I always thougth I never paid sufficient attention to that subject. The subject basically covered some optimization models and for some reason AI was there, just sky-high level mentions in some classes.</description>

      <description>Why am I not graduated yet? Graduation is something we all are longing. Well, I recognize this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been evading. The main reason is because I&amp;rsquo;m not working on what I studied. But, what the hell, I think I like Data Science.
Ok, Long Story Short&amp;hellip; I was about to study Mathematical Engineering but I asked myself, where can I possibly work as a Mathematical Engineer ? (In my current job, obviously ðŸ˜…)</description>

      <description>What is a Artificial Neural Network? The Picture you see up there is far a way from what a real Neural Network looks like:
Actually it is more similar to something like this:
  Deep Leaning Network  
The configuration showed above is nothing but a visual representation of serial Matrix Multiplications. The neural network (aka ANN that stands for Artificial Neural Networks) itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m almost a Civil Engineer that for well-unknown reasons ended up working as a Data Scientist prior to finish my Thesis Project (more to come on this) and it seems I enjoy it.
I like Data Science and I love to solve the Rubiks&amp;rsquo;s Cube, so for now you should have figured out why the site name.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at Evalueserve for the last 4 years working in some interesting and a lot of not-so-interesting Data Science projects.</description>
