      <description>Deep Learning Well, I got to know Deep Learning by chance. I remember to have had a College subject called Operational Investigation Fundamentals and they taugth Artifical Intelligence algorithms. Neural networks were mentioned but I never thought I could even understand what they were about. During my first real job (as a quasi-Engineer) I always thougth I never paid sufficient attention to that subject. The subject basically covered some optimization models and for some reason AI was there, just sky-high level mentions in some classes.</description>

      <description>What is a Artificial Neural Network? The Picture you see up there is far a way from what a real Neural Network looks like:
Actually it is more similar to something like this:
  Deep Leaning Network  
The configuration showed above is nothing but a visual representation of serial Matrix Multiplications. The neural network (aka ANN that stands for Artificial Neural Networks) itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs1.</description>
